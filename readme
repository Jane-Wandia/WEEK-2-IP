##Description

This is my akan names generating website.it works by generating names.
 When one enters his/her biRthday.These names are named after names of 
the week and are diffferent for each gender. Try it and lets have some fun,

The naming of children is of great importance in
all Akan societies, as it is believed that the name given 
to a child can affect his behaviour and destiny. Besides, the
family name that is given to the child the day the child is born
is very significant as it actually becomes the first name of
the person. In West Africa, newborns are given special names depending
on the day they are born.
